##  About the Project

Sentiment analysis is a text classification technique that analyzes the polarity of textual data—positive, negative, or neutral. This project:
- Loads and cleans user review text data
- Converts text into numerical features
- Trains multiple machine learning models
- Evaluates and compares model performance
